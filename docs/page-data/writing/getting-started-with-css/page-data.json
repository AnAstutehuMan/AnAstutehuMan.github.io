Minecraft: Java Edition can run on all operating systems. So, we are going to be installing Java JDK and optimizing the server for better performance.</p>\n<h2>Seting up the Minecraft Server</h2>\n<h3>Updating the system</h3>\n<p>Regardless of where you install the server, it is highly recommended to update all system packages to the lastest/stable version. To update and upgrade in Linux, type:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">sudo apt-get update &#x26;&#x26;\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade -Vy &#x26;&#x26;\nsudo apt-get autoremove -y &#x26;&#x26;\nsudo apt-get autoclean &#x26;&#x26;\nsudo apt-get clean \n</code></pre>\n<p>Now go to finish and reboot for the new updates to apply.</p>\n<h3>Installing the server and its dependecies</h3>\n<p>Minecraft: Java Edition works with <code>Java JDK</code> in the backend, so letâ€™s install a copy of the default JDK package. Or, the licensed Java-edition from Oracle.</p>\n<p>Enter the following command to install the stable version of Java:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">sudo apt install default-jdk\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can verify whether Java was installed by typing: <code>java --version</code>.</p>\n<p>Now that Java is successfully installed, we can go ahead and fetch the Minecraft server file from Spigot and its builder tools by typing the command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\"># Creates a folder in the root directory.\nmkdir ./minecraft\n# Navigates to the folder created.\ncd ./minecraft\n# Pulls the lastest files from Spigot required to build the server.\nwget https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/BuildTools.jar\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Building the Serer</h2>\n<p>Now we want to run the build tools file, so it creates our Spigot server. It takes about 15-30 minutes to finish. Grab a coffee and relax!\nAdd <code>--rev [versionNumber]</code> to the end of the command to get the latest version. If the version number is not specified, it installs the latest copy available.\n<code>java -jar BuildTools.jar</code>\nTo make sure the Spigot server successfully downloaded and saved type ls and should see <code>spigot-1.14.4.jar</code>.\n<code>shell ls</code>\nFor the commands to work, it is required to stay in the same directory as the configuration files.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"getting-started-with-css"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
