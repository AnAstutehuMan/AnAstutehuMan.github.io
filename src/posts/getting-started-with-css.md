The following tutorial uses the Spigot version of Minecraft and running on Linux. Minecraft: Java Edition can run on all operating systems. So, we are going to be installing Java JDK and optimizing the server for better performance.

## Seting up the Minecraft Server

### Updating the system

Regardless of where you install the server, it is highly recommended to update all system packages to the lastest/stable version. To update and upgrade in Linux, type:

``` shell
sudo apt-get update &&
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -Vy &&
sudo apt-get autoremove -y &&
sudo apt-get autoclean &&
sudo apt-get clean 
```

Now go to finish and reboot for the new updates to apply.

### Installing the server and its dependecies
Minecraft: Java Edition works with `Java JDK` in the backend, so letâ€™s install a copy of the default JDK package. Or, the licensed Java-edition from Oracle.

Enter the following command to install the stable version of Java:
``` shell
sudo apt install default-jdk
```

You can verify whether Java was installed by typing: `java --version`.

Now that Java is successfully installed, we can go ahead and fetch the Minecraft server file from Spigot and its builder tools by typing the command:

``` shell
# Creates a folder in the root directory.
mkdir ./minecraft
# Navigates to the folder created.
cd ./minecraft
# Pulls the lastest files from Spigot required to build the server.
wget https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/BuildTools.jar
```

## Building the Serer

Now we want to run the build tools file, so it creates our Spigot server. It takes about 15-30 minutes to finish. Grab a coffee and relax!
Add `--rev [versionNumber]` to the end of the command to get the latest version. If the version number is not specified, it installs the latest copy available.
`java -jar BuildTools.jar`
To make sure the Spigot server successfully downloaded and saved type ls and should see `spigot-1.14.4.jar`.
` shell
ls
`
For the commands to work, it is required to stay in the same directory as the configuration files.
